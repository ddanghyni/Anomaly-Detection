> The recent rapid development of deep learning has laid a milestone in industrial image anomaly detection (IAD). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of deep learning-based image anomaly detection techniques, from the perspectives of neural network architectures, levels of supervision, loss functions, metrics and datasets. In addition, we extract the promising setting from industrial manufacturing and review the current IAD approaches under our proposed setting. Moreover, we highlight several opening challenges for image anomaly detection. The merits and downsides of representative network architectures under varying supervision are discussed. Finally, we summarize the research findings and point out future research directions. More resources are available at https://github.com/M-3LAB/awesome-industrial-anomaly-detection.

- & We review the recent advances of deep learning-based image anomaly detection since the rapid development of deep learning can bring the capabilities of image anomaly detection into the factory floor. In modern manufacturing, image anomaly detection (IAD) is always performed at the end of the manufacturing process and tries to identify product defects. The price of a product is significantly affected by the defect′s severity. In addition, if the flaw reaches a certain threshold, the product will be discarded. Historically, the majority of anomaly detection tasks are performed by humans, which suffers from the following many disadvantages: [(p. 104)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NUF92HMP?page=104&annotation=64DY2QUD)
